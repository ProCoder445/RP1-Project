      There are many places to learn how to develop VR Applications. Places like:

    <p>And the most popular application to develop VR Applications is Unity, a 3D game engine.</p>

    <span id="Pros">

    <h3 class="heading">
      Pros
    </h3>

    <p>There are many Pros to using Virtual Reality Applications ("VRA"). Of these, there are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Education: People can visit simulated environments.</li>
      <li>Entertainment: People can explore places and interact with things as they would in real life.</li>
      <li>Production Speed: VR can help companies test prototypes before physically making the product. This reduces the cost for companies as they build products.</li>
      <li>Surgery: VR can help surgeons get more information in real time when doing a surgery. In addition, surgeons could place VR object on a patient's body to communicate findings to the rest of the surgical team</li>
    </ul>

    <span id="Cons">

    <h3 class="heading">
      Cons
    </h3>

    <p>While there are also Pros to using VRA, there are also cons. These include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Privacy Concern: Spyware can watch the movement of players, and AI can turn that movement into words with 90% accuracy. </li>
      <li>Cost: Developing a 3D World can cost money, as skilled developers, 3D artists, and a lot of time.</li>
      <li>Lag: Loading that much data takes time, often leading to lag in the VR experience.</li>
      <li>Scalability: VRAs may not be able to support many users on the same game simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>

    </span>

    <span id="Solutions">

    <h3 class="heading">
      Solutions
    </h3>

    <p>Here are some solutions to the Cons listed above</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Solution to Con #1: Privacy Concerns - Using Transparent contracts to specifically convey the information stored and how it is used. Using Data Minimization to store as little data as possible. Stripping data of anything that can be traced to a person directly.</li>
      <li>Solution to Con #2: Cost - The use of AI to debug code can significantly reduce time. In addition to this, AI can create rough 3D models for artists to work with.</li>
      <li>Solution to Con #3: Lag - As technology imporves, both hardware and software will become more efficient. Also, Delta State Syncing (DSS) can be used to minimize lag. An increased bandwidth can also help large groups of people to play simultaneously.</li>
      <li>Solution to Con #4: Scalability - The Solution to scalability lies in part with the solution to Lag. DSS could be used to minimize packet size, and data compression could be used to minimize that size even further. Also, dividing a VR world into seperate "chunks" and rendering each chunk only when the player is in them is another way to improve Scalability.</li>
    </ul>
