      Pros
    </h3>

    <p>There are many Pros to using Virtual Reality Applications ("VRA"). Of these, there are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Education: People can visit simulated environments.</li>
      <li>Entertainment: People can explore places and interact with things as they would in real life.</li>
      <li>Production Speed: VR can help companies test prototypes before physically making the product. This reduces the cost for companies as they build products.</li>
      <li>Surgery: VR can help surgeons get more information in real time when doing a surgery. In addition, surgeons could place VR object on a patient's body to communicate findings to the rest of the surgical team</li>
    </ul>

    <span id="Cons">

      Cons
    </h3>

    <p>While there are also Pros to using VRA, there are also cons. These include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Privacy Concern: Spyware can watch the movement of players, and AI can turn that movement into words with 90% accuracy. </li>
      <li>Cost: Developing a 3D World can cost money, as skilled developers, 3D artists, and a lot of time.</li>
      <li>Lag: Loading that much data takes time, often leading to lag in the VR experience.</li>
      <li>Scalability: VRAs may not have the necessary components to be run on certain hardware.</li>
    </ul>
