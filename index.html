      Pros
    </h3>

    <p>There are many Pros to using Virtual Reality Applications ("VRA"). Of these, there are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Education: People can visit simulated environments.</li>
      <li>Entertainment: People can explore places and interact with things as they would in real life.</li>
      <li>Production Speed: VR can help companies test prototypes before physically making the product. This reduces the cost for companies as they build products.</li>
      <li>Surgery: VR can help surgeons get more information in real time when doing a surgery. In addition, surgeons could place VR object on a patient's body to communicate findings to the rest of the surgical team</li>
